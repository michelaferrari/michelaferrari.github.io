			<h2>A B O U T</h2>
			<p> Hi, I'm Michela. </p>
			<p> I take pen and paper wherever I go - to jot down ideas, to doodle something that sparks my interest or to simply let my mind wander. </p>
			<p>I'm a designer from Lima, Peru who is passionate about creating unique solutions that revolutionize experiences for human beings, whether generated through digital platforms, services or actual products.</p>
			<p>I believe design and communication go hand in hand.</p> 
			<p>I am currently a junior at Northwestern University, majoring in Communication Studies with a minor in Business Institutions and completing the Segal Certificate in Design.</p>

				<h3> Industrial Design Sketches </h3>
				<p> For these design sketches, I originated concepts from scratch after creating a competitive audit and moodboard. After generating thumbnail sketches, I consolidated concepts and developed a single idea for each project. All of the sketches have been created by hand, using Pilot Fineliners andPrismaColor Premier Art Markers. </p>

				<h3> Happiness 3 </h3>
				<p> Happiness 3 is a subscription box service, developed alongside a team of 4 students for an entrepreneurship class. It provides college students happiness in small doses, by receiving small curated gifts sent from home. During 10 weeks, we generated (and pivoted from) our concept, established the marketing, financial and launch plans. I was in charge of the visual identity and branding. </p>

				<h3> Changing The World Via Venture Creation </h3> 
				<p> My team developed a new shopping concept called Fashtag to improve user experience with online shopping.  We created a new concept where the user could find shopping items by searching compiled shopping lists, curated by experts and users. The goal was to create a customizable shopping experience based on style, mood and trend, while making the process faster and more efficient. We conducted research through questionnaires and industry analysis. We created our final concept, integrated marketing and expansion plans, as well as a profit-and-loss and risk analysis. </p>
